# Qt Learning
User Interfaces written with the Qt framework using various techniques as a journey of self-discovery and to learn the best practices of working with Qt.

This project can be considered a constant work in progress, it is used for experimentation and testing with no functional goal in sight; only the goal of learning.

# Windows

Windows are able to be launched in various contexts; standalone and Autodesk Maya contexts. This means you can write the UI once and embed it into various software applications (Autodesk Maya, for example).

Run this:
```commandline
$ # run this. 
``` 

# Usage and Testing

Here is an example usage:
```commandline
$ # run this. 
```

Or if you'd like to use the widgets inside your own UIs, try this:
```python
# do stuff here
```

To open all the UIs in this project for testing, run the following command:


# Development

## Convention

- PEP8 Python convention for code.
- All UIs are first creataed in Qt Designer.
- UIs are always saved into ./ui directory.  

## Design

- All UI pieces must be re-usable
