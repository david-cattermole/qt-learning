# Qt Learning
User Interfaces written with the Qt framework using various techniques as a journey of self-discovery and to learn the best practices of working with Qt.

This project can be considered a constant work in progress, it is used for experimentation and testing with no functional goal in sight; only the goal of learning.

Take a look at the various windows (and screenshots) [here](https://github.com/david-cattermole/qt-learning/blob/master/docs/windows.md)
